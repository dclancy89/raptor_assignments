        <h1>Module 5 Question 3 - Programming Challenge 6 on page 327</h1>
        <p>Help users calculate their car's miles per gallon. Write a program to allow a user to enter the number of miles driven and the number of gallons of gas
            used. The output should be the miles per gallon. Use a <span class="code">Do...While</span> (post-test) loop to allow users to enter as many sets of
            data as desired.
        </p>

        <h2>Program</h2>

        <p>Simulating a <span class="code">Do...While</span> loop with javascript and html is a bit weird, but humor me? It doesn't actually use a do while loop, but it acts like one!</p>
